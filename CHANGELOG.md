# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Admin device form: saving any device with `source4` or `source6` set returned a 500. `asyncpg` cannot bind a Pydantic `IPv4Address`/`IPv6Address` to the TEXT columns used for source IPs, so every save with a non-empty source IP failed with `invalid input for query argument ... expected str, got IPv4Address`. `create_device`/`update_device` now serialise the payload with `model_dump(mode="json")`, which coerces IP objects to strings (and is a no-op for the `INET` address column, which accepts both).
- Admin panel: creating, editing or deleting a device via `/admin/devices/*` no longer silently skips webhook delivery. Only the REST `/api/devices` paths fired `device_create`/`device_update`/`device_delete` events before; the SSR admin panel (which is what operators actually use) went directly through the CRUD layer. Parity restored — both surfaces now emit the same payload.
- Admin devices list: the Health column no longer shows `• Healthy` for devices that have never had a successful query or probe. A new `• Unknown` state (slate bullet) is shown until the first success is recorded, so newly-added unreachable devices are visibly distinguishable from devices that are actually working.

### Changed

- `<select>` controls now render a consistent custom chevron positioned with a small gap from the right border, replacing the browser-default arrow which hugged the edge inconsistently across Chrome/Firefox/Safari. Applied to the home page Query type selector.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- `BGPEEK_MAX_PREFIX_V4` (default `24`, range 8–32) and `BGPEEK_MAX_PREFIX_V6` (default `48`, range 16–128) — the previously hardcoded cutoff for input validation and public output filtering is now configurable. Operators can raise the limit to expose more-specifics (e.g. `/27`) if their threat model allows it. Defaults are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `BGPEEK_PUBLIC_OUTPUT_LEVEL=restricted` now correctly hides fields from both UI and JSON responses. Previously the level stripped communities, local_pref and MED from `parsed_routes` but left them intact in `filtered_output` (the CLI text), so unprivileged users still saw them via the "Show raw" toggle in the UI and via the JSON field in the API.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Admin panel: web UI for managing devices, SSH credentials, users, community labels, and webhooks (CRUD for each).
- Admin panel extras:
  - per-device query stats on the devices list
  - circuit breaker status per device
  - "Query this device" quick link from the devices list
  - "Test SSH" button on the device edit form
  - community labels count on the landing page
- `AGENTS.md` — guidance file for AI coding agents and human contributors (stack, layout, hard rules, workflow, adding a vendor platform, security notes).

### Changed

- `BGPEEK_PRIMARY_ASN` is now optional. When unset, `site_name` falls back to just `bgpeek` (no `AS<N>` prefix) and the PeeringDB icon is hidden regardless of `BGPEEK_PEERINGDB_LINK_ENABLED`. Behaviour is unchanged when the ASN is set.
- Dev workflow: `compose.dev.yaml` now bundles a `tailwind` watcher container that rebuilds `static/css/tailwind.css` on template changes. No host `tailwindcss` binary required.

### Fixed

- Security: queries against devices flagged as `restricted` are no longer executed for unprivileged callers. Previously the device was correctly hidden from the dropdown and the REST device listing, but `POST /query` with a known-or-guessed name would still run the SSH command. Unprivileged callers now get the same "not found" response as for a non-existent device.

### Internal

- Device form UX: platform selector as a proper `<select>`, source v4/v6 fields stacked for readability.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- First-class branding configuration for UI identity and behavior:
  - `BGPEEK_PRIMARY_ASN` (digits-only)
  - `BGPEEK_BRAND_PAGE_TITLES` for per-page title suffix overrides
  - `BGPEEK_BRAND_FOOTER` for optional footer HTML
  - `BGPEEK_BRAND_CUSTOM_CSS` for custom CSS injection
  - `BGPEEK_PEERINGDB_LINK_ENABLED` to toggle the PeeringDB header icon
- ASN-driven defaults for branding:
  - site name defaults to `AS<PRIMARY_ASN> bgpeek` when unset
  - PeeringDB URL is derived from `BGPEEK_PRIMARY_ASN`
- PeeringDB header icon link with bundled asset at `/static/peeringdb.png`.
- Unified top-bar user menu (login/logout, guest/user label, account settings visibility).
- `Continue as guest` action on `/auth/login` when `access_mode` is `guest` or `open`.
- Russian locale translations added with English-fallback merge behavior in i18n.

### Changed

- Footer branding behavior reworked:
  - `bgpeek` + version is always visible and links to source
  - optional custom footer segment appears only when configured
  - legacy configurable source label/URL behavior removed
- Page title branding moved from a single tagline to per-page suffix mapping.
- Header/navigation behavior is consistent across index, history, and shared result pages.
- Configuration docs and examples were updated for the branding and links feature set.
- Configuration docs/examples now explicitly document session/output controls:
  - `BGPEEK_ACCESS_MODE`
  - `BGPEEK_PUBLIC_OUTPUT_LEVEL`

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Dedicated `sixwind_os` BGP parser behavior for Cisco-like output quirks:
  - ignores non-path preamble lines under `Paths:`
  - parses `Last update:` into BGP route age

### Changed

- 6WIND BGP command templates switched to prefix form:
  - `show bgp ipv4 prefix {target}`
  - `show bgp ipv6 prefix {target}`
- RPKI integration now targets Routinator validity API format directly:
  - default API URL changed to `http://routinator:8323/api/v1/validity`
  - request URL path uses `/{origin_asn}/{prefix}`
  - response parsing uses `validated_route.validity.state`
- Webhook model and signing flow tightened for safer secret handling defaults.
- Development container hardening updates in Docker/dev compose.
- Test and documentation fixtures sanitized to reserved documentation IP/ASN ranges.

### Fixed

- 6WIND BGP parsing no longer misclassifies peer advertisement preamble lines as route paths.
- 6WIND age column population for parsed BGP routes.
- RPKI status mapping for Routinator response variants (`valid`, `invalid`, `not-found`/equivalents).
- Multiple command/parser/integration tests updated to match real 6WIND command behavior and routing output structure.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Community label annotations from a DB-backed catalog, including optional color badges and row highlighting in BGP results.
- BGP table enhancements: Age column support, active-route highlighting for Junos, and clearer best-path marker placement.
- UI/UX refinements for result rendering, including improved light/dark theme behavior and raw output interaction updates.
- Social preview assets for the repository.

### Changed

- Query command dispatch now auto-detects IPv4/IPv6 family from target input.
- Input handling now strips and validates target values earlier in the UI/request flow.
- Internationalization scope simplified: removed Russian locale while retaining i18n scaffolding.
- Shared Jinja template wiring centralized in `core.templates`.
- CI/release workflow dependencies updated (`actions/checkout@v6`, `astral-sh/setup-uv@v7`, `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`, and dependabot metadata tooling updates).
- Dependency baseline updated (including `asyncpg`, `bandit`, `pre-commit`, and `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`).

### Fixed

- Junos BGP parser improvements:
  - parse active path state correctly
  - parse `Metric:` as MED
  - strip trailing AS-path annotations (e.g. originator markers)
- BGP output handling:
  - strip leading license banners more robustly
  - return explicit "Network not in table" UX state for empty route results
- DNS target validation now rejects numeric shorthand forms that may be ambiguously resolved by `getaddrinfo`.
- Query validation hardening for ping/traceroute targets: reject unspecified, broadcast, multicast, and link-local destinations.
- Multiple BGP table presentation and copy-to-clipboard usability issues.
- Ruff formatting cleanups required for CI consistency.
