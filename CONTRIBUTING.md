# Contributing to bgpeek

Thank you for considering contributing to bgpeek! This guide will help you get started.

## Development setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.12+, PostgreSQL, Redis (optional).

```bash
# Clone and install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/XeoneriX/bgpeek.git
cd bgpeek
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Run linter and formatter
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

## Running locally

```bash
# Start dependencies (PostgreSQL + Redis)
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# Run the app in debug mode
BGPEEK_DEBUG=true BGPEEK_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://bgpeek:bgpeek@localhost:5432/bgpeek bgpeek
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with auto-reload enabled.

## Code style

- **Linter/formatter:** [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) — configuration is in `pyproject.toml`
- **Type hints:** required on all public functions (Pydantic v2 strict mode)
- **Language:** code, comments, and documentation in English
- **Tests:** pytest + pytest-asyncio — aim for coverage on new features

Run before committing:

```bash
ruff check src/ tests/ --fix
ruff format src/ tests/
pytest
```
